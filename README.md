# DSA Practice Repository

Welcome to my **DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms)** practice repository! 🎉 This repository is dedicated to learning and practicing various DSA concepts, algorithms, and coding problems. All the solutions and examples are implemented in **C++**.

## 📚 What You'll Find Here

This repository includes:

- **Array Problems**: Solutions to various problems related to arrays, including searching, sorting, and manipulation.
- **Patterns**: Code for generating different patterns using loops and recursion.
- **Algorithms**: Implementation of fundamental algorithms like sorting, searching, dynamic programming, and more.
- **Data Structures**: Practice with stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, graphs, and other data structures.
- **Problem-Solving**: Solutions to problems from competitive programming platforms.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Language**: C++
- **IDE/Compiler**: Any C++ compiler or IDE of your choice (e.g., GCC, Visual Studio, Code::Blocks, etc.)

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rameshwarTiwari1/DSA-Practics
   ```
2. Navigate to the desired folder to explore specific topics or problems.
3. Compile and run the code using your preferred C++ compiler.
4. Give the input in input file or you can use terminal and see ouput in ouput.txt file or in your terminal.

## 🌟 Goals

- To strengthen my understanding of DSA concepts.
- To practice problem-solving skills regularly.
- To prepare for coding interviews and competitive programming contests.
